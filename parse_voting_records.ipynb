    "Since 1990 all roll-call votes in the house that were performed electronically have been recorded and are available from https://clerk.house.gov. Our goal will be to download this data and reformat it into a convenient form for working with. Specifically we would like to have, for each year, the voting record for each representative, ideally as a numeric vector of their votes on each item. To do this the first thing we will need to do is collect all the data itself. We can manage that with a series of shell commands."

    "The next catch is that the votes are recorded in a number of ways. Sometimes it is \"Yea\" or \"Nay\", sometimes \"Aye\" or \"No\". There are also abstentions (voting \"Present\", or a recording a \"Not Voting\"). Finally there are the votes for House speaker at every new congress (i.e. every 2 years); these are recorded as the names of the individuals being voted for as speaker. This final option is harder to deal with because we have a plurality of options rather than the traditional Yes/No/Abstain. For the sake of relatively simple analysis, and since we are mostly concerned with how house representatives align amongst each other, we will select the two most popular candidates and code republican candidates as -1 and democratic candidates as +1 (rather arbitrarily).\n",
